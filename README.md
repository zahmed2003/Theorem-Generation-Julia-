To create a new branch, run the commands:

    git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"

    git clone https://github.com/zahmed2003/Theorem-Generation-Julia-.git

    git checkout -b issuex

After this, run git status to make sure the branch is correct.

To open an existing branch, run the command

    git checkout issuex
    
   Commiting is the same as above

To push your code up, run the command git status again. You will see all the files that have been changed. 

    git add example.file 
   to all changed files
    Run 
    
    git commit -m "description of changes"
    git push origin issuex
